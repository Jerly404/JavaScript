ðŸ“˜ JavaScript - General Introduction
JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used for web
development. It allows developers to create interactive and dynamic web pages by manipulating
the content, structure, and style of websites in real-time. JavaScript runs in the browser,
meaning it doesn't require a separate environment to execute, making it essential for
client-side development.

Created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while working at Netscape, JavaScript has evolved into one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Today, it's not only used on the client-side but also on the server-side thanks to environments like Node.js.

With the rise of modern frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue, JavaScript has become a fundamental language for full-stack development. Its wide adoption, massive community, and extensive library ecosystem make it a powerful tool for building everything from simple websites to complex web applications.
